# About
This is the main website where I push all my activities.

# Technology
I use [notion](https://www.notion.so/) to make my notes. Thats pretty much it.

# Workflow
1. Update the notes on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). I use the web version; desktop and mobile app also available.
2. Export it to HTML.
3. Extract the zipped file, and rename the base html file to index.html
4. Finally, I push the changes to github.

For the workflow to work, we need to configure github pages in the repo settings.

Further, you will notice I use a custom domain, ie www.manasvi.co.in. This can also be set in the github repo settings.
